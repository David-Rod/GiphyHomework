# GiphyHomework

The purpose of this page is to add animated Gifs to the page as determined by the user. The user may choose from an existing set of animals to add Gifs to the page, or search for a desired animal. The searched animal will then be added to the array of existing buttons and can be clicked on at a later time.

This particular activity helped me with my ability to utilize JSON and ajax calls. I was able to use the JSON as part of the API to decide which specific attributes I needed to display the Gifs on the page. Once I had that information, I could then use an ajax call to retrieve the kind of Gif I would need for each specific animal.

The most difficult component of this activity was the search component. It is more difficult to retrieve information than it is to change existing data on a page. Data manipulation of retrieved information was a bit complex, and required me to think ahead. I had to relate the information I had accessed to the new data and make a relationship between them. The relationship was based on the functions and variables I had defined earlier in the assignment.
